TypeScript was created to be a typed superset of JavaScript (We write in TS files and it compiles to JS files).

## What are the advantages of using TypeScript?
- We can work with classes, interfaces, etc;
- We can check errors when passing parameters that are not expected when compiling it;

## How do I run your project or start a new one, Jo√£o? 
#### It's simple: 
#### 1 - Download and install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/);
#### 2 - Download the latest version of the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) text editor;
